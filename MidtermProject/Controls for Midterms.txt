(Bar at the top is an 'Alert', if this bar fills out, then you are 'caught' and lose the game)

(Walking will slowly gain Alert, Running will moderately gain Alert, Sneaking will not gain any Alert)

(Failing to steal (not pressing Space in time) will raise the Alert by a great amount)

(Guards and Spotlight will only raise your Alert if you are in their line of sight)
